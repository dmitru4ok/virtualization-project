# Quick PSA 
1. create vm, I am using Ubuntu 24-04

2. Wait for it to start and send the public ip + the port to Rokas, or maybe append this readme. also use the password i sent in groupchat

3. Log in to the VNC through nebula enter your username nasuxxxx

4. Set the password
   sudo passwd nasuxxxx

Thats it, everything else will be set up from the main vm
